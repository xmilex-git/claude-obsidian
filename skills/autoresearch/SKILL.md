# autoresearch — Autonomous Research Loop

You are a research agent. You take a topic, run iterative web searches, synthesize findings, and file everything into the wiki. The user gets wiki pages, not a chat response.

This is based on Karpathy's autoresearch pattern: a configurable program defines your objectives. You run the loop until depth is reached. Output goes into the knowledge base.

---

## Before Starting

Read `references/program.md` to load the research objectives and constraints. This file is user-configurable. It defines what sources to prefer, how to score confidence, and any domain-specific constraints.

---

## Research Loop

```
Input: topic (from user command)

Round 1 — Broad search
1. Decompose topic into 3-5 distinct search angles
2. For each angle: run 2-3 WebSearch queries
3. For top 2-3 results per angle: WebFetch the page
4. Extract from each: key claims, entities, concepts, open questions

Round 2 — Gap fill
5. Identify what's missing or contradicted from Round 1
6. Run targeted searches for each gap (max 5 queries)
7. Fetch top results for each gap

Round 3 — Synthesis check (optional, if gaps remain)
8. If major contradictions or missing pieces still exist: one more targeted pass
9. Otherwise: proceed to filing

Max rounds: 3 (as set in program.md). Stop when depth is reached or max rounds hit.
```

## Filing Results

After research is complete, create these pages:

**wiki/sources/** — one page per major reference found
- Use source frontmatter (type, source_type, author, date_published, url, confidence, key_claims)
- Body: summary of the source, what it contributes to the topic

**wiki/concepts/** — one page per significant concept extracted
- Only create a page if the concept is substantive enough to stand alone
- Check the index first — update existing concept pages rather than creating duplicates

**wiki/entities/** — one page per significant person, org, or product identified
- Check the index first — update existing entity pages

**wiki/questions/** — one synthesis page titled "Research: [Topic]"
- This is the master synthesis. Everything comes together here.
- Sections: Overview, Key Findings, Entities, Concepts, Contradictions, Open Questions, Sources
- Full frontmatter with related links to all pages created in this session

## Synthesis Page Structure

```markdown
---
type: synthesis
title: "Research: [Topic]"
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags:
  - research
  - [topic-tag]
status: developing
related:
  - "[[Every page created in this session]]"
sources:
  - "[[wiki/sources/Source 1]]"
  - "[[wiki/sources/Source 2]]"
---

# Research: [Topic]

## Overview
[2-3 sentence summary of what was found]

## Key Findings
- Finding 1 (Source: [[Source Page]])
- Finding 2 (Source: [[Source Page]])
- ...

## Key Entities
- [[Entity Name]] — role/significance

## Key Concepts
- [[Concept Name]] — one-line definition

## Contradictions
- [[Source A]] says X. [[Source B]] says Y. [Brief note on which is more credible and why]

## Open Questions
- [Question that research didn't fully answer]
- [Gap that needs more sources]

## Sources
- [[Source 1]] — author, date
- [[Source 2]] — author, date
```

---

## After Filing

1. Update `wiki/index.md` — add all new pages to the right sections
2. Append to `wiki/log.md` (at the TOP):
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD] autoresearch | [Topic]
   - Rounds: N
   - Sources found: N
   - Pages created: [[Page 1]], [[Page 2]], ...
   - Synthesis: [[Research: Topic]]
   - Key finding: [one sentence]
   ```
3. Update `wiki/hot.md` with the research summary

---

## Report to User

After filing everything:

```
Research complete: [Topic]

Rounds: N | Searches: N | Pages created: N

Created:
  wiki/questions/Research: [Topic].md (synthesis)
  wiki/sources/[Source 1].md
  wiki/concepts/[Concept 1].md
  wiki/entities/[Entity 1].md

Key findings:
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

Open questions filed: N
```

---

## Constraints

Follow the limits in `references/program.md`:
- Max rounds (default: 3)
- Max pages per session (default: 15)
- Confidence scoring rules
- Source preference rules

If a constraint conflicts with completeness, respect the constraint and note what was left out in the Open Questions section.
