# Claude SEO v1.9.0 Slides and GitHub Release Session

Date: 2026-04-15 | Outputs: `claude-seo-slides/v190.html`, GitHub release v1.9.0

## What Was Built

### HTML Slide Deck (claude-seo-slides/v190.html)

15-slide community presentation for the v1.9.0 release. Scroll-snap HTML, no external library. Matches the existing v1.7.2 dark-theme brand exactly.

**Tech pattern:**
- `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory` on `html`, each slide `min-height:100vh` + `scroll-snap-align: start`
- `IntersectionObserver` per slide to update progress bar and nav dots
- Keyboard: ArrowDown/Right/Space to advance, ArrowUp/Left to go back
- `file:///` absolute paths for local screenshots with `onerror` fallback handlers

**Brand:** `#0A0A0A` bg, `#E07850` coral accent, Space Grotesk headings, IBM Plex Mono body. `.claude/`, `.superpowers/` added to `.gitignore` before push.

**Slide structure (15 slides):**

| # | Title | Key Content |

| 01 | Title | 23 skills, 5 contributors, 4 new skills, 30 scripts |
| 02 | Executive Summary | 8 metric cards, community wins, technical wins |
| 03 | The Challenge | 3 cards, full 8-stage timeline table |
| 04 | Community Posts | Announcement + winner screenshots (local file paths) |

| 15 | What's Next | v1.9.1 H1/H2/M1 deferred items, Challenge v2 LEADS |

**Screenshot paths note:** `claude-seo-slides/v190.html` contains 7 absolute `file://` home paths for community post screenshots. Not sensitive, but not portable. `onerror` handlers show placeholder text when images fail. Works in Firefox; Chrome blocks cross-origin `file://` image requests.

### GitHub Release v1.9.0

**Steps taken:**
1. Fixed `SCREENSHOTS_DIR` hardcoded path in `scripts/release_report.py`: replaced the old absolute home Downloads path with `Path.home() / "Downloads" / "..."` (Path was already imported).
2. Added `.claude/` and `.superpowers/` to `.gitignore`.
3. Staged 68 files (31 modified, 37 new), committed as `feat: v1.9.0 Pro Hub Challenge community integration`.
4. Remote had 1 commit ahead ("Remove blog links from README") — resolved with `git pull --rebase`.
5. Tagged `v1.9.0` on HEAD, pushed tag.
6. Created GitHub release via `gh release create v1.9.0` with PDF attached (`Claude-SEO-v1.9.0-Release-Report.pdf`). No HTML slides attached as release asset.

**Release URL:** https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-seo/releases/tag/v1.9.0

**Commit stats:** 68 files, 9,662 insertions, 51 deletions.

## Key Lessons

1. **`Path.home()` for user-relative paths in scripts** — never hardcode `/home/username/...`. Use `Path.home() / "..."` or `os.path.expanduser("~")`. Catches before push with a simple `grep -rn "/home/"`.
2. **Always `git pull --rebase` before pushing a big local commit** — even on solo repos with active GitHub Actions or web edits. Avoids a merge commit cluttering the history.
3. **`gh release create` attaches assets directly** — pass file path as positional argument. Only attach what users actually need to download (PDF), not presentation assets (HTML) that live in the repo.
4. **`.claude/` and `.superpowers/` should always be in `.gitignore`** — they hold project-specific Claude Code permissions and plugin state. Not credentials, but not repo content either.
5. **Chrome blocks `file://` cross-origin image requests** — HTML files opened as `file://` cannot load images from other `file://` paths in Chrome. Firefox allows it. For portable local HTML with images, use `python3 -m http.server` or embed images as base64 data URIs.
