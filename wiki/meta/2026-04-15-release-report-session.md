# Claude SEO v1.9.0 Release Report Session

Date: 2026-04-15 | Output: `~/Desktop/Claude-SEO-v1.9.0-Release-Report.pdf`

## What Was Built

13-page dark-theme PDF release report for Claude SEO v1.9.0. Generated via `scripts/release_report.py` using WeasyPrint + matplotlib. Covers: Pro Hub Challenge contributions, architecture evolution, review score progression, security audit findings, DataForSEO cost guardrails, and Challenge v2 announcement.

**Stats**: 13 pages, 1.53 MB, 4 charts, 7 screenshots embedded, logo visible on title page.

**Brand**: Space Grotesk font, `#0A0A0A` background, `#E07850` accent (rust-orange), `#111111` cards, `#2D2D2D` borders. Matches SVG Diagram Style Guide.

## Bugs Fixed

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix |
|-----|-----------|-----|
| Logo not rendering | Filename has double space: "AI MArketing hub  pro logo with white text.png" | Corrected path in `generate_report()` |
| `file://` images not loading | Spaces in paths not URL-encoded | Added `_file_url()` helper with `urllib.parse.quote()` |
| Review checker false WARNs | Checked URL-encoded paths against filesystem | `unquote()` before `Path.exists()` |
| Title page empty bottom half | Fixed `height:297mm` + sparse content | Removed fixed height, added "In This Report" card |
| Contributor card page-break orphans | `display:table-cell` is atomic in WeasyPrint | Replaced two-column layout with stacked blocks |
| Architecture scripts table orphaned | 7-row table split across pages | Replaced table with paragraph |
| Security highlight box orphaned | Orphaned after large table | Merged text into intro paragraph |
| Chart page mostly empty | Chart too small relative to page | Increased figsize height, moved chart first in section |

## WeasyPrint PDF Lessons

1. **`file://` URIs must be URL-encoded** — spaces become `%20`. Use `urllib.parse.quote(path, safe="/:@")`. When reviewing paths extracted from HTML, use `unquote()` before `Path.exists()`.
2. **`display:table-cell` is atomic** — WeasyPrint cannot break a table-cell across pages. For content that might span pages (contributor cards, multi-row content), use stacked block elements (`<p>` + `<ul>`) instead of two-column table layouts.
3. **Fixed height causes empty space** — `height: 297mm` on a div with sparse content leaves blank below. Use auto height + generous padding instead.
4. **Tables that overflow: replace with paragraphs** — if a table consistently orphans its last rows, a `<p>` with inline `<code>` spans is more reliable.
5. **Chart figsize controls page fill** — matplotlib figsize directly affects how much of the page the chart occupies. Increase height to fill empty space after a chart.
6. **`max-height: 165mm` on `.chart-container img`** — good default for charts on their own section page.
7. **Check filenames carefully** — "AI MArketing hub  pro logo with white text.png" has a double space between "hub" and "pro". `Path.exists()` is the fastest way to catch this.
