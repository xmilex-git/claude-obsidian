## Last Updated

2026-04-24: Phase 3.5 hardening pass. Cross-phase audit ran (codex rated original Phase 1-3 output cross-phase risk as "high" with 10 hold-ship items). All 10 resolved: doc-lint contradiction fixed, Mechanism 4 labeled NOT IMPLEMENTED, DragonScale Memory.md assigned `address: c-000001`, agents/wiki-ingest.md + agents/wiki-lint.md updated to reflect Phase 2+3, hooks.json extended to stage `.vault-meta/`, `bin/setup-dragonscale.sh` created as opt-in installer, `tests/` + `Makefile` added (all tests pass), versions synced to 1.5.0 across plugin.json + marketplace.json, CHANGELOG.md created.

2026-04-23 (3): Phase 3 complete. Semantic tiling lint shipped as opt-in. `scripts/tiling-check.py` (485 lines) with flock-guarded atomic cache, localhost-locked OLLAMA_URL default, symlink rejection, model-drift invalidation, and banded thresholds (error>=0.90, review>=0.80, conservative seeds). 4 codex review rounds, 10/10 accept.

2026-04-23 (2): Phase 2 complete. Deterministic page addresses MVP via `scripts/allocate-address.sh` (flock-guarded, recovers counter from max observed). New frontmatter `address: c-NNNNNN`. `wiki-ingest` and `wiki-lint` updated with opt-in Address Assignment and Validation sections. 3 codex rounds, 8/8 accept.

2026-04-23 (1): Phase 0-1 complete. DragonScale Memory spec (`wiki/concepts/DragonScale Memory.md` v0.3) plus `skills/wiki-fold/` for Mechanism 1 (log rollups, dry-run verified). Survived multi-round codex review.

## Plugin State

- **Version**: 1.5.0 (bumped from 1.4.3; plugin.json + marketplace.json synced)
- **Install ID**: `claude-obsidian@claude-obsidian-marketplace`
- **Skills**: 11 (wiki, wiki-ingest, wiki-query, wiki-lint, wiki-fold, save, autoresearch, canvas, defuddle, obsidian-bases, obsidian-markdown)
- **Scripts**: `scripts/allocate-address.sh`, `scripts/tiling-check.py` (both opt-in; feature-detected by skills)
- **Setup**: `bin/setup-vault.sh` (base vault), `bin/setup-dragonscale.sh` (opt-in DragonScale), `bin/setup-multi-agent.sh` (multi-agent bootstrap)
- **Tests**: `make test` runs `tests/test_allocate_address.sh` + `tests/test_tiling_check.py`. Zero ollama dependency for core tests.
- **Hooks**: 4 (SessionStart, PostCompact, PostToolUse [stages wiki/, .raw/, .vault-meta/], Stop)

## DragonScale Mechanisms

1. **Fold operator** (Mechanism 1): `skills/wiki-fold/`, dry-run verified. No fold committed yet in this vault.
2. **Deterministic addresses** (Mechanism 2): shipped; vault counter at 2 (DragonScale Memory.md holds c-000001).
3. **Semantic tiling lint** (Mechanism 3): shipped; awaiting `ollama pull nomic-embed-text` to activate in this vault.
4. **Boundary-first autoresearch** (Mechanism 4): **NOT IMPLEMENTED**. Design sketch only in the spec; `autoresearch/SKILL.md` unchanged.

## Key Lessons from This Release Cycle

1. Cross-phase audits are essential. Individual phase reviews miss drift between phases.
2. Opt-in feature detection (`[ -x script ] && [ -f state ]`) preserves default plugin behavior for adopters and non-adopters alike.
3. PostToolUse hook matcher is `Write|Edit` — Bash writes don't fire it. Scripts that mutate tracked state must be Bash-only to avoid side-effect commits.
4. Seed-vault self-consistency matters: if the spec says post-rollout pages need addresses, the concept page itself has to have one.
5. Codex adversarial review rounds stop when the punch list is empty, not when the author feels done.

## Style Preferences

- No em dashes (U+2014) or `--` as punctuation. Periods, commas, colons, or parentheses. Hyphens in compound words are fine.
- Short and direct responses. No trailing summaries.
- Parallel tool calls when independent.

## Active Threads

- DragonScale Mechanism 4 (boundary-first autoresearch) is designed but not implemented; ship when a Phase 4 is triggered.
- v1.5.0 not yet pushed to GitHub. User controls the push timing.
- CLAUDE.md has one pre-existing uncommitted change ("Release Blog Post" section) that predates this session.
